B) How would you find files that begin with "0aH" and delete them given a folder (with subfolders)? Assume there are many files in the folder.

C) Write a function that sorts 11 small numbers (<100) as fast as possible. Estimate how long it would take to execute that function 10 Billion (10^10) times on a normal machine?

D) Write a function that sorts 10000 powers (a^b) where a and b are random numbers between 100 and 10000? Estimate how long it would take on your machine?
